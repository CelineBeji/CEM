The Infant Health and Development Program is a randomized experiment that began in 1985 in the US designed to reduce the developmental and health problems of low birth weight premature infants. This semi-synthetic dataset was compiled by J. Hill (2011) for causal effect estimation. It contains 10*747 units and 25 covariates measuring children characteristics like birth weight and head circumference and some features related to their mothers as if they smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol or took drugs. The treatment and control groups are imbalanced by removing a biased subset of the treated population.
